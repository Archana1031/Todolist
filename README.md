# Todolist
A To-Do List Project is a simple yet highly functional application designed to help users organize, prioritize, and manage their tasks efficiently. The core idea is to allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks, while also enabling them to mark tasks as completed or pending. 

 # Workflow of a To-Do List Project in Django

**Project Setup:**
Install Django using pip install django.
Create a new Django project: django-admin startproject todo_project.
Create a new app within the project: python manage.py startapp todo_app.
Configure the app in the project’s settings (add 'todo_app' to INSTALLED_APPS).

**Database Setup:**
Define the Task model in models.py of the todo_app, which will store task data like title, description, completion status, and due date.
Run migrations to create the database schema: python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.

**User Authentication:**
Utilize Django’s built-in authentication system for user registration, login, and logout functionality.
Create views and templates for user authentication (login, signup, logout).

**Views and URLs:**
Define views in views.py to handle logic for displaying the task list, adding new tasks, editing tasks, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as completed.
Configure URLs in urls.py for routing to the respective views for tasks and user authentication.

**Task CRUD Operations:**
Create: A form for adding new tasks, which collects data like task name, description, and due date.
Read: Display the list of tasks to the user, either showing all tasks or filtering by completion status.
Update: A form to edit task details.
Delete: A way for users to delete tasks.

**Template Design:**
Use Django’s templating engine to render HTML pages for the task list and forms.
Create a clean, user-friendly interface for interacting with tasks, including task status (complete/incomplete), editing, and deletion options.

**Styling and Interactivity:**
Use CSS for styling the UI.
Optionally, add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., AJAX for task completion without refreshing the page).

**Testing and Debugging:**
Test the application locally by running python manage.py runserver and accessing it via a browser.
Fix any bugs or issues related to task functionality, form validation, and authentication.

**Deployment:**
Prepare the project for deployment on a web server (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS).
Set up production database, collect static files using python manage.py collectstatic, and configure server settings (e.g., ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py).

# **Technologies Used**

**Django:**
Framework: The core framework for developing the web application, handling routing, models, views, and templates.

**Python:**
The programming language used to write the backend code and handle business logic, forms, and data processing.

**SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL:**
Database: Django uses SQLite by default for development, but can be configured to use PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.

**HTML/CSS:**
Frontend: HTML is used to structure the content and CSS is used to style the frontend of the app.

**JavaScript (Optional):**
Frontend Interactivity: Adds client-side behavior (e.g., task completion via AJAX without page refresh).

**Django Templates:**
The templating engine for dynamically rendering HTML pages with data from the database.

**Django Forms:**
Handles form rendering and validation for user input, especially for adding or editing tasks.

**Django Authentication System:**
Built-in system for handling user registration, login, logout, and session management.

**Git/GitHub (Optional):**
Version control for managing code and collaborating with others.
